### Growing Up


Our mission is to simplify good and environmentally friendly parenthood by making science accessible to parents.
We believe that playtime can be optimised for cognitive development through science. Our solution is a digital platform for parents with children up to 5 years old. The platform gives access to parental guidance, playtime tips, and a tracking function. Through the Growing Up service, we aim to dematerialise fun and developing playtime.
